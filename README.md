Being a busy full-time dad for a 6 years old first grader and a 4 years old preschooler, I need a simple App to maintain to-do-list. When switing to the driving mode, it can show me photos about the location in the list and driect me to the destination by one click.  


## Main Features
* To Do list for Category and Items/location.
* Show location on a map and direct user to the Location (GPS) by one click.


## Main Goals:
* Easily add/delete Category and Items. ( Swipe to delete)
* One click to mark done and undone
* Store Data locally ( **Core Data** )
* One click show items in MAP in Driving mode ( **MapKit** )
* Show Flickr photos about the location. ( **REQS API Web services** )
* Open MAP App(GPS) by one click to show direction for the location.

## Resource
* Cocoapods ([here](https://cocoapods.org/))
