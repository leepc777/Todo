Being a busy full-time dad for a 6 years old first grader and a 4 years old preschooler, I need a simple App to maintain to-do-list. When switing to the driving mode, it can show me photos about the location in the list and driect me to the destination by one click.  


## Main Features
* To Do list for Category and Items/location.
* Show location on a map and direct user to the Location (GPS) by one click.


## Main Goals:
* Easily to add Category and Items with auto correction keyboard.
* **swipe** to delete. An UNDO button to undo.
* One tap to mark done and undone
* Store Data persistently ( **Core Data** )
* In driving mode,tap the item to show it on a MAP ( **MapKit** )
* Show Flickr photos about the location. ( **REQS API Web services** )
* Tap the location to open **MAP App** to show direction (GPS).
